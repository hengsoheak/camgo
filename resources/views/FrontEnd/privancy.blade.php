                        <h3>Privacy Policy General</h3>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>Camvgo is committed to protecting your privacy. We have
                        developed this Privacy Policy so that you may easily understand the way in
                        which we protect your user data we collect from you and other related
                        information.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>This Privacy Policy applies to Camvgo which is referred to
                        in this Privacy Policy as “we,” “us,” “our” or Camvgo.” Camvgo provides
                        engaging content for its users, including quizzes, personality tests, and
                        casual games.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>The Privacy Policy is available to the public at all times
                        so you may read the full text of the Privacy Policy on Camvgo’s website
                        whenever you need or want to do so. Camvgo will notify you of any changes to
                        the Privacy Policy by posting an amended version or amendments to its website
                        to notify you of changes.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AND/OR COLLECT</h3>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>1. We collect information from a number of sources. First,
                        users can log into Camvgo website using authentication services of third
                        parties.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>If you use your Facebook user name and password to log into
                        our website, we receive the following types of information about you from
                        Facebook:</p>

                        <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
                         <li class=MsoNormal>Your Facebook user name.</li>
                         <li class=MsoNormal>The gender designation you provided Facebook.</li>
                         <li class=MsoNormal>Your Facebook profile picture.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>2. Second, we receive and/or collect other types of data and
                        information about users when they use our website. For instance, we receive
                        users’ input in response to quiz or personality test questions. We make no
                        attempt to link your quiz answers or personality test choices or results to
                        individual identities.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>3. Third, we receive your Facebook app-scoped ID. The
                        app-scoped ID is a unique identifier for a user, which is unique to a given
                        application. Thus, the app-scoped ID we receive is only used for Camvgo, and we
                        cannot identify our user’s Facebook user ID (Facebook-assigned unique
                        identifier), with this app-scoped ID. Facebook does not share with us the link
                        between an app-scoped ID and a Facebook user ID.</p>

                        <p class=MsoNormal>4. Except for the information described above, we do not
                        receive any other information from social networks used for login purposes. In
                        accordance with social media service features, we may show the information that
                        social media service provider directly provide to your device. However we do
                        not receive or store that information.</p>

                        or professional services and who have committed to maintaining the
                        confidentiality of such user data. Otherwise, we will never sell or disclose
                        user data to a third party in a personally identifiable way. Nonetheless, we
